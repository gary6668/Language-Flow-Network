# 🧠 Language Flow Network

> “Language is not a set of independent samples — it is an observable stream of emotional dynamics.”

## 🌍 Overview
**Language Flow Network (LFN)** proposes that natural language is a *continuous dynamic process* rather than an independent token sequence.  
We empirically measure **temporal mutual information (MI)** between sentence embeddings using the **InfoNCE** estimator.

When temporal order is preserved (“original”), MI remains high;  
when order is randomized (“shuffle”), MI drops — proving that language carries *temporal dependency and emotional continuity*.
